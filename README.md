# Convolutional Neural Network
Implementation of a simple Convolutional Neural Network in NumPy as a project for the course Visual Intelligence, TDT17

The notebook CNNs.ipynb goes through the forward pass and backward propagation of the network, and is structured as a learning example in which certain problems are to be solved, and are presented and followed by their solutions. This notebook also contains extensive documentation and visualization of the different output of layers. 

The python file CNNs.py integrates what is presented in the notebook in a train/test classification problem. Here the network is trained and tested, its performance is determined, and some of its predictions are visualized.

A .pdf is also provided, giving the possibility to view the jupyter notebook solution in pdf.
